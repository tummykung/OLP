<h1>Why OLP?</h1>

We continue existing projects by two Mudd alum: Ryan and Niel.
  The existing projects are the following:
  <ul>
  	<li><a href = "http://learntrace.herokuapp.com/"> Learntrace </a></li>
  	The motto of this site is "Don't just look. Learn!" You can 
  	put video links in your "streams". Then you can schedule those.
  	Basically you create your own course of study, and you can share
  	those with other people too.

  	<li><a href = "http://learnstream.heroku.com/"> Learnstream </a></li>
  	This one has nice exercises. You can watch mini-lectures, solve problems, 
  	track your progresses, and get better in your class.

  	<li><a href = "http://beta.learnstream.org/"> Learnstream Beta </a></li>
  	This site was used as a supplement of Math 131: Real Analysis 
  	class taught by Prof. Su. It has all the lectures. Students can 
  	view the lectures before class, or review it. 
  	Other features include flashcards that anyone can post and share with
  	classmates.
  </ul>



  <h2>Some new ideas include:</h2>
  <ul>
  	<li>Interactive quizzes</li>
  	<li>Breaking videos lessons into small chunks </li>
  	<li>Make a course that stands on its own (for people who don't enroll for the class). This is more difficuly, so we put it off until later </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Things that are already known how to do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> This semester we learned quite a bit
      of Ruby on Rails, so that this page
      is possible. </li>
    <li> Add a math equation like this: 
      $\sqrt{9 + 4\sqrt{5}} - \sqrt{9 - 4\sqrt{5}} = 4,$ or like this
      \[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.\]
      We use MathJax for this one.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Some Models</h2>
<ul>
	<li> <a href = "http://www.coursera.com/">Coursera</a>:
		This is a great model of online learning platform that has
		been popular lately. It offers many great great classes
		for free. There are more than 200 courses (as of December 2012)
		with a partnership of about 20 universities.
	</li>
	<li> <a href = "http://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a>:
		This is antoher great model of online learning platform.
	</li>
	<li> <a href = "http://class.stanford.edu/">Class2Go</a>:
		This is another online learning platform. It is open source, but
		it uses Django (python-based) framework. We can still learn 
		many things from it though.
	</li>
	<li> <a href = "http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>:
		This one has a feature that you can teach code.
		We can adapt this idea to allow students here at Mudd
		to teach whatever they want.
	</li>
	<li> <a href = "http://learnstream.heroku.com/">Learn Stream</a>:
		Explained above.
	</li>
	<li> <a href = "http://learntrace.heroku.com/"> Learn Trace</a>:
		Explained above.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some Tools to Learn</h2>
<ul>
	<li> <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/js/">Javascript</a>:
		It will make the website much more interactive.
	</li>
	<li> <a href = "http://popcornjs.org/">Popcorn.js</a>:
		I'm not sure what this exactly does. My impression is that
		it brings HTML ability to work nicely with videos.
	</li>
</ul>
